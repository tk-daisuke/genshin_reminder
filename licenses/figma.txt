Maybe like yourself, I spend loads of time searching around for the resolution data, DPI, & mockups for many modern devices. So, I created a new project & I wanted to share!

To see all data, visit whatsthatsize.design.

Have suggestions? Let me know! @joeyabanks on Twitter.

Made with lots of ðŸ’›.

All mockups were created by the talented team over @FacebookDesign.
